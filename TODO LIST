TODOS:

- rewrite method for testing for a winner in Board class (right now, every time 
someone makes a move, it tests all possible formations for a win on the board. 
I (gloria) was being very dumm. it only has to test the location that a piece
was just moved in, just in all 8 directions. the current method works for now
but an amendment at some point would be nice. :D
  (Shounak here) This can be done later, there is no point trying to make a working
  thing "better" when we have other stuff to do.
